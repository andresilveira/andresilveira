I believe in a world where computers empower people's abilities, where humans are pleased to use computer applications rather than being annoyed by them.
By crafting thoughtful- well tested - user focused application, I am able to put my beliefs into action and deliver value to people, saving them time and money ([which is kinda the same thing according to B. Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Is_Money){:target="_blank"}).
