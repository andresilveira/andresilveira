I recently read [Are Knobbies the Best Adventure Motorcycle Tires for Noobs?](http://www.advpulse.com/adv-prepping/best-adventure-motorcycle-tires/) and at first I didn't get it. I mean, why wouldn't someone want proper tires for off road, right?
Some time passed, my stock Metzler [METZLER LINK] got worn out so it was time for a replacement. Since I'm riding 90% of the time on pavement (in Germany you need to ride a bit to get in a track that either isn't private or environmently protected), I went on and bought the Hidenau K60 Scout [TIRES LINKS].

So I did the usual, entered the track slowly and accelerated once I felt more confident. And here is the key, I felt confident really quick! And the best is that with those new dual sport tires, the usual oh-my-god-soft-terrain wasn't much of a problem anymore.

Then you ask me, so, what about the stock tires talk? Here's the interesting part. Dual sport tires won't save you all the time. The motorcycle will get sideways and in these moments the skills I've built, driving slowly with those slick tires, are what will save your ass.
