<h3>Bring back the joy of programming in on going projects</h3>
<p>Yep, I'm sure we all already experienced the feeling of "nah this feature/project is driving me nuts :/ ". The author makes an analogy between a application's code and a story in a sense that our code should tell a coherent narrative rather than a pile of <em>nil </em>checking and conditionals here and there.</p>
<p>The book is structured as a (easy to apply) patterns catalog. And, in turn, those patterns are can be used in one or more of the four stages of a method: <strong>gathering inputs, performing work, deliver response and handling errors</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are a short list of the ones I could apply the most and also made my life easier:</p>
<h4>Always built in conversors on 'boundary' methods</h4>
<p>Methods that receive inputs from outside its class should take an extra care about the inputs it accepts without being too obsessive (<a title="Principle of Robustness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle" target="_blank">be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept</a>). So, time to pull out that old friends <code>#to_s</code> and <code>#to_i</code>, for example, and use them whenever you need a input to behave like a String or a Integer in a method.</p>
